Naturally, the first thing they did with it was die horribly! The second thing they did with it was ignore the manual and play with it like a toy.\r\n\r\nIn time, that one left the shelter of the Stable and went on to do great things. But the horses left behind were impatient and just as bored as before. So they began a plan to send out settlers to find fun things to do outside and to bring fun things back inside.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
