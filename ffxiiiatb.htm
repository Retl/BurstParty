// Purpose: To emulate the 'ATB Refresh' aspect of FFXIII's ATB system.
// This is also repurposing a bunch of cobbled together code from w3schools and
// elsewhere on the net to do things with arcs on an html canvas.
// Biggest thing I personally got out of this as of 11Mar2013 is my first use of
// of setInterval instead of setTimeout.
//
// Funny. My intial goal was to do a top-down Contra-type rotate-y thing.
// Oh well. Progress.
