	Purpose: This is the Stable 45 index/homepage. It gives some brief introductory info on what Stable45 is, as well as giving navigation to other parts of the site. More detailed information about what Stable 45 is and intends to do should be available in the About page.

	Permissions: If you want to use elements from this page, please ask me first. I'm generally pretty open and willing to share, but it's better to ask than to not. You can email me at travisuped@gmail.com.  storytime@revelromp.com also works.

<p>Once upon a time in a magical land, there lived an isolated underground shelter for horses.</p>

<ul>
<li>Those horses were smart.</li>
<li>Those horses were silly.</li>
<li>Those horses were bored.</li>
</ul><p>Over two hundred years after the great accident that doomed a world to a brown and grey fate, survivors in underground Stable-Lab Forty-Five Research and Development gave that one resident a prototype gadget with ultimate power over all life, all physics, and all of reality. Naturally, the first thing they did with it was die horribly! The second thing they did with it was ignore the manual and play with it like a toy.</p>

<p>In time, that one left the shelter of the Stable and went on to do great things. But the horses left behind were impatient and just as bored as before. So they began a plan to send out settlers to find fun things to do outside and to bring fun things back inside.</p>
