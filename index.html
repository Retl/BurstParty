<p>Once upon a time in a magical land, there lived an isolated underground shelter for horses.</p>

<ul>
<li>Those horses were smart.</li>
<li>Those horses were silly.</li>
<li>Those horses were bored.</li>
</ul><p>Over two hundred years after the great accident that doomed a world to a brown and grey fate, survivors in underground Stable-Lab Forty-Five Research and Development gave that one resident a prototype gadget with ultimate power over all life, all physics, and all of reality. Naturally, the first thing they did with it was die horribly! The second thing they did with it was ignore the manual and play with it like a toy.</p>

<p>In time, that one left the shelter of the Stable and went on to do great things. But the horses left behind were impatient and just as bored as before. So they began a plan to send out settlers to find fun things to do outside and to bring fun things back inside.</p>
